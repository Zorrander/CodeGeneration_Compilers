# CodeGeneration_Compilers

This repository consists of a compiler written in C++ for the SnuPL/1 language.

It compiles SnuPL/1 source code to 64-bit Intel assembly code.

SnuPL/1 is an imperative procedural language closely related to the Oberon programming language,
one of the many languages developed by Prof. Niklaus Wirth. SnuPL/1 does not support object orientation
and the only composite data type supported are arrays (not records, enumerations).
